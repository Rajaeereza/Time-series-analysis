# Time-series-analysis

This report presents the findings and analysis from a
project that focused on two key areas: time series
analysis of total vehicle sales in the US and analysis of
sports car prices. The primary objective was to gain
insights into the trends, patterns, and relationships
within these datasets. The project utilized the Federal
Reserve Economic Data (FRED) dataset and the Kaggle
Sports Car Prices dataset for the analysis.
